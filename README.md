## Introduction to R

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. One of Râ€™s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. 

## The R environment

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes

- an effective data handling and storage facility,
- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

## What is this repo?

This repo contains tutorials about data science with R that talked about in [1 YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUkHNM4hVvI).
